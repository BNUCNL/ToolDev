# Analysis on the Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

This repository contains a collection of tools and models developed for operations based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The `Model` directory is organized into subfolders that cover various methods and techniques to leverage DNNs for different tasks. Below is a detailed description of each subdirectory and its purpose.

## Repository Structure

### `dimension_reduction`
The `dimension_reduction` folder includes scripts for applying dimensionality reduction techniques using DNNs. Examples include autoencoders that learn compressed representations of high-dimensional data. These methods help in reducing the complexity of data while retaining essential features, enabling efficient analysis and improving computational performance in subsequent tasks.

### `other_network`
The `other_network` folder contains implementations of various custom neural network architectures. This includes models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and other experimental architectures developed for specific research purposes. These networks are useful for exploring different representations of data, unsupervised learning tasks, or generating new data that follows the same distribution as the original data.

### `transfer_learning`
The `transfer_learning` folder provides scripts and tools for applying transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on new tasks with limited data. This folder includes code for leveraging popular pre-trained networks (such as ResNet, VGG, etc.) to solve new challenges, improving efficiency and accuracy in model training.
